# Mission Statement
Satellites are launched, placed in orbit, and remain unchanged for their entire lives. Although missions and operating environments change, satellites on orbit remain unchanged for their entire lives. If mission needs change, existing systems have very little capability to adapt and
augment to mission standards once on orbit. This work proposes to extend the life of assets on orbit with the intent to add new revolutionary capabilities to help protect existing and future on orbit assets. We will pursue on-orbit capabilities through key developments in various areas including: Self-deployable construction of modular structures; Unique assembly and deployment of new decentralized/autonomous methods; On-orbit attachable components (OACS) for existing structures; Inspection of convoluted structures for repair; Interactive and Intelligent Inspection for existing vehicles in orbit; and further exploit a larger library of space grade materials. The proposed developments will foster a new age of space missions and generate the necessary technologies to ignite a space-age economy.
